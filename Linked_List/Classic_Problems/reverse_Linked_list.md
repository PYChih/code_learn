# Reverse Linked List
- Reverse a singly linked list.
  - one solution is to iterate the nodes in original order and move them to the head of the list one by one
    - in this algorithm, each node will be moved exactly once.
    - therefore, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the linked list.
    - We only use constant extra space so the space complexity is O(1)
- [ ] A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively.
