# Array related Technique

1. There are somo other data structures which are similar to the array but have some different properties:
   1. String
   2. Hash Table
   3. Linked List
   4. Queue
   5. Stack
2. It is useful to understand the principle of some widely-used technique used to search a specific element in a sorted array.
3. Binary search is also an important technique used to search a specific element in a sorted array.
4. two-pointer technique can also be used to solve:
    - Slow-pointer and fast-pointer problem in Linked List
    - Sliding Window Problem
5. The two-pointer technique sometimes will relate to Greedy Algorithm which helps us design our pointers' movement strategy.
